**what is python** 

python is considered as one of the easiest coding language 
    - the code is close to human langage to allow human to read it 
    - very efficient for any project 

You can see it as a tool box 

    we use always use some tools like screw or screw driver (basic python words)
    we can buy some more efficient or specialized tools ( called librarie )
    each tool should be used on a good way to be efficient (code rule and logic)

for this classe we will only focuse on the basic tools but with python you can do 
annything you want (website, trading bot, ai, game, automating your boring task)
**in the class we have start by the diferrent type of screw ( called data type )**

as the screw each data ( or variable ) has speciale use called a type
the main are 
   
    - the INT (for interger) define an integral number (no decimal)
    - the float are number that can has decimal (or no they are free)
    - the boléan : can be true or false ( also equal 1 and 0 but not usefull)
    - the string : its considered has suite of charactere , it start and end by " (ex "hello" or "1")
    - the array who is just a table with différent var, you have to write on [] (ex [1,2,"nice"])
    
    - the tuples is harder but remember as an array that cant change , you write it on () (ex (1,2,"stop"))

    you can make your make your own screw (with "name"="value") but it will always be part on one of the upper categorie

**now we have screw but we need screw driver and one of the easiest screw driver is math :**
you can make any operation of math whith any type EXEPT TUPLES 
for exemple 1 + 4 = 5 
you can also use word it will put them side to side  exemple ("hiroshi" + " hall" = "hiroshi hall")

**math are cool but we dont like the so we have invent boucle**
it make an action untill reaching an condition
the main boucle are 
    - while = run untill reaching the objectiv 
    - for = run for an define number of time 
    ***when using an boucle every element to repeat have to be tabulate***

**to complete our tools box we have create some special glue**

- index : use with an aray or a tuple, it count the position of each element (like book page)
be careful index always considere start by 0 (page 0 then 1,2,3 ...)
- Item : count the number of element 
     If you got 10 apple and 3 peach index go from 0 to 12 but Item =2

**now you know how to code : you just have to put these element on a special order like a recipe**
